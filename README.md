## 🧠 Design Principles

- **Modular Architecture** – Organized JS files by responsibility
- **SOLID Principles** – Separation of concerns, single responsibility
- **No Page Reloads** – SPA-like experience using JavaScript only
- **Minimalist UI** – Clean layout without using UI templates

---

## 📌 Notes

- This project avoids using frameworks like React/Vue to emphasize vanilla JS mastery.
- All dynamic actions (search, filter, wishlist toggle) are handled client-side using JavaScript.
- The project was built as part of a challenge to demonstrate functional, modular, and responsive web development.
